    <h1>The SWA Newsletter: Month Of January</h1>
    <h2>
      Important Notice: The SWA will have both Discord and Guilded servers made
      publicly available for people to sign up for meetings and get additional
      help.
    </h2>
    <h3>Regarding Anxiety</h3>
    <p>
      According to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/">CDC</a>, 10.3% of students of ages 12 - 17 experience extreme
      anxiety. The <a href="https://www.nih.gov/">National Institutes of Health</a> say that almost 1 in 3 teens
      from ages 13 - 17 will experience an anxiety disorder at least once in
      that age range. At the SWA, we notice that most of the children going to
      our meetings are in that age range. That is why one of our goals is to
      help and support those with anxiety, and hopefully get to a point where
      our clients are no longer going through anxiety and can begin to better
      live their lives to the fullest. <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/">The Substance Abuse and Mental Health
      Services Administration</a> encourages teenagers to seek help from a trusted
      adult, counselor, or mental health support group when you are suffering
      from anxiety. We try to act as the support group for you, but it may still
      be smart to talk to your guidance counselor from time to time. All advice
      given from the other mental health websites is good, but here is what the SWA has to say: When dealing with
      anxiety, try to take a break. Go outside for 5-10 minutes and think about
      the good things in your life. If you can't go outside, take a break from
      all work and screens for a few minutes, and maybe read a good book. Than
      go back to the hard parts in life with a clear mind. It will be easier to
      do things if your mind is cleared. We understand that current issues can
      be the most anxiety inducing of all, so if you need any help, you can
      always talk about it with us, your guidance counselor, or a counselor
      outside of school.
    </p>
    <h3>Goals</h3>
    <p>
      The SWA has goals, but we understand that most of you do too. That is why
      we encourage everybody to work hard at your goals, as it is much more
      satisfying to accomplish a goal than to give up on it. Additionally, the
      SWA wants to help you reach your goals, and we will try to do whatever you
      need us to do to make your goals easier to accomplish. However, everybody
      should take goals seriously. Some people have real, serious goals and
      nobody should make fun of other people's goals or have any goals that
      aren't serious and take our time away from goals that might be more
      serious. We ask that you take your and other people's goals as seriously
      as you can.
    </p>
    <h3>Final Notice</h3>
    <p>
      Be safe, especially with COVID-19 and variants of COVID-19. We can make
      2022 better than 2021 and 2020, but only if we all do our part!
