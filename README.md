This website, https://studentwellnessalliance.glitch.me/, was made with the express purpose to represent the SWA, or the Student Wellness Alliance, as the official website. This website contains the monthly newsletter put out by the Student Wellness Alliance, and is therefore updated monthly or if bugs are reported. The SWA was made for the Sharon Public School students.
This website and all of it's contents were created and edited in Glitch (https://glitch.com/).
